# Coding Standards & Best Practices

## Documentation Philosophy

### Remove "What" Comments
Code should be self-documenting. Only add comments that explain **why**, never **what**.

### No Markdown Files Unless Requested
**FORBIDDEN**: Creating .md files (README, CHANGELOG, docs, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks for them.

Only create documentation files when the user specifically requests:
- "Create a README"
- "Add documentation"
- "Write a guide for X"

## Code Style

### Type Hints Always
All function parameters and returns must have type hints.

### Modern Python Features
Use modern Python features (Python 3.13).

### No Unnecessary Complexity
Prefer simple, readable code over clever solutions.

## Dependencies

### Use uv for Package Management
Always use `uv` commands, never pip directly.

## Summary
**Key Principles:**
1. Code is self-documenting - no "what" docstrings
2. Only comments that explain "why"
3. Type hints everywhere
4. Modern Python features
5. **NO markdown files unless explicitly requested**
